## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

In the past, I've worked on:
- Enabling data-centric decision-making @ Deloitte.
- Optimizing cloud spend @ Cox Auto


### Projects:
- **Attack Map**: Developed a custom log parser in Rust to visualize attempted logins on a Linux system. Check it out [here](https://github.com/notedwin/attack-map).
- **Screen Time Data Pipelines**: Designed and implemented data pipelines using Dagster to process and analyze personal screen time data. Find it [here](https://github.com/notedwin/log-screen).
- **HaxML**: Built machine learning models to predict expected goals (xG) for the online soccer game, HaxBall. Explore the project [here](https://github.com/vingkan/haxml).

- And some more bad code!
